### Hi there 🙋‍♀️

<p>My name is Camila Polo and I'm very curious about technology.💻 </p>

<p> I would actually say that I'm curious about a bunch of stuff and this is probably the reason why I'm always studying something new. 🤭</p>


<p>I decided to transition to a career in technology and to achieve this goal, I've been studying Systems Analysis and Development at University as well as taking a graduate course in Data Science.</p>


<p> At the moment, I'm studying Python, SQL, Machine Learning and Statistics.
