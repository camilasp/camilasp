### Hi there 🙋‍♀️

<p>My name is Camila Polo and I'm very curious about technology.💻 </p>

<p> I would actually say that I'm curious about a bunch of stuff and this is probably why I'm always studying something new. 🤭</p>


<p>I decided to transition to a career in technology and to achieve this goal, I've been studying Systems Analysis and Development at University since the beginning of 2021, as well as doing other courses online.</p>


<p> At this moment, I'm taking a course in Data Science 📊 because it's my main area of interest in tech.
